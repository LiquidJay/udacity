Find where the subl command is located. 
subl comes with Sublime, so it should be in the directory where Sublime is located for you.  For many people, this is /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin.  To test this, run ls /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin.  You should see the subl command listed.  If you get the error No such file or directory, Sublime is located somewhere else for you and you'll need to find it.

If you do not have a file named .bash_profile in your home directory, create it.  Because the name of this file begins with a period, it will not appear in most file navigators or when you run ls.  Instead, run ls -a to see if you have the file.

Add the line export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin to the end of your .bash_profile.  If subl was in a different directory for you in step 1, use that directory.

Close and re-open your terminal.  Typing subl in the terminal should now open Sublime.
